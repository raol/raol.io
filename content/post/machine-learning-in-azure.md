It's a really long pause between this post and previous one, but I hope to get pace and write more frequently.

This time we will review new Azure Machine Learning service that was announced recently and will solve that "boring"
linear regression task (from my previous posts) using the ML service.

<!--more-->

First of all it's really cool that anyone, who is not familiar with machine learning internals and has only tenuous understanding of 
how it works, can upload data and classify/estimate/make predictions. But on the other hand, I can't say, that Azure ML is a silver bullet,
at least it was easier to me to code solution in Python than use Azure.

I assume that you familiar with Azure and have trial or paid account there. If not, it worth creating it and playing a little. It's free
for 30 days. Anyway let's get started.

First of all we need to create Machine Learning workspace. After filling all required fields, new ML workspace is created and you can 
start you analysis. It appears at your Azure dashboard, just click on it, and then click *Go To ML Studio* link.

To start analysis, we have to create dataset first. Certainly, sample dataset can be used, and Azure provides them for tests and experiments.
But since we are in context of our previous posts on ML topic, let's use our old dataset. You can download dataset [here](/assets/files/ex1data1.txt),
if you want to repeat my post step by step.

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/create_dataset.png)

Choose any name for the dataset and specify *CSV file with header* in the **Dataset type** field.

Now it's time to create _Experiment_. On the bottom panel choose _Add new_->_Experiment_ which is kind of intuitive step.

New window looking as at the picture below will be opened and you can finally start modeling process.

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/new_experiment.png)

First of all we need our dataset to be used. Expand _Saved Datasets_, find it there and drag to the experiment window. Then we need to choose columns
we want operate with, i.e. our feature columns and label column. Drag item _Data Transformations_ -> _Manipulation_ -> _Project Columns_ to the experiment window, click it
and at the right side of the ML studio in the task properties click _Launch column selector_. Since we have only two columns in our dataset we won't spend
too much time in the settings window. Choose _Begin With_ -> _All columns_ and remove any error rows that are below this label. Now your experiment window should 
look like below

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/experiment_proj_col.png)

Now we have to choose which column we're trying to predict, i.e. label column. To do it, drag _Data Transformation_ -> _Manipulation_ -> _Metadata Editor_. 

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/metadata.png)

In the properties of the _Metadata Editor_ task at the right side (OK, this is the last mention of the "right side". All properties are displayed there, so 
I won't say it again and again) of your experiment launch column selector and choose following configuration there.

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/metadata_columns.png)

as I told we need to choose which column is label, i.e. which one is the outcome of our experiment. All other columns act as input values. 
As we're estimating profit of the city based on its population, it's clear that `profit` column is our label.

Close the window and go to the properties window again and configure following values there

* Data Type - Double
* Categorical - NonCategorical
* Fields - Labels

By the way, you can play a little with the added data and visualize them to view relationship between features and labels. 
To do it, point mouse to the output port of the _Dataset_ task, click it and in the drop-down menu choose visualize.
You can click columns to add them to the plot and in the top of the view, if `compare to` is filled in, relation between columns
is displayed.

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/visualize.png)

So now we have everything to train our model and estimate profit value of the any city population.

Drop following items to the experiment: _Machine Learning_ -> _Initialize Model_ -> _Regression_ -> _Linear Regression_ and
_Train_ -> _Train model_.

Then connect output port of the _Metadata Editor_ to the right or `dataset` port of the _Train Model_ item and left or
`untrained model` port of the _Train Model_ task to the one and only port of the  _Linear Regression_ task. After it's done,
you will have trained model and ready to estimate new values of the profit by the city population.

Drag _Machine Learning_ -> _Score_ -> _Score Model_ to the experiment and connect its `dataset` port to the _Metadata Editor_
and `trained model` to the task _Train Model_. If you did everything right, experiment would look like this

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/final_experiment.png)

It's time to run it and check our results.

Press Run button and after experiment is executed, click `scored model` port of the _Score Model_ dataset to open results 
window. Unfortunately linear function coefficients are not reported by the ML tool, but you can build scatter plots to see
original labels and estimated ones.

![create-dataset](/assets/images/azure_ml/original_estimated.png)

At the end of your experiment you should have estimates like at the picture above.

And that's it.
