      <title>Logging with log4net in Azure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though you can configure basic logging for Azure using built in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics/&#34;&gt;diagnostic tools&lt;/a&gt;
sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to have more control on logging. So it might be a good idea
to use log4net on top of the azure diagnostics and configure it to fit all your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Azure. Publishing.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raol.io/2014/07/21/machine-learning-in-azure/&#34;&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; post I explained how to create new 
Azure machine learning experiment and how to use linear regression to make predictions.
The experiment is pretty cool itself as any other one, but there is one minor problem with it.
It&amp;rsquo;s totally useless. Oh, you certainly can open it up and run all steps manually each time you need
to predict profit (I&amp;rsquo;m still talking about previous post with synthetic experiment and synthetic dataset)
based on city population, but, agree, it&amp;rsquo;s not very suitable. It would be nice if you had a way
to store your trained model and supply data you need to analyze, and get back results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really long pause between this post and previous one, but I hope to get pace and write more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we will review new Azure Machine Learning service that was announced recently and will solve that &amp;ldquo;boring&amp;rdquo;
linear regression task (from my previous posts) using the ML service.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
