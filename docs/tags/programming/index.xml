      <title>Poor man language identification.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Language identification, as it&amp;rsquo;s easy to guess, is the task of identifying the language
of a document. For instance search engines may store the language of the indexed document
and provide option such as &lt;em&gt;Search for English results only&lt;/em&gt; as Google does. But in order
to store the language, engine should determine it first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s a pleasure to abandon that very-cool-enterprise development, to
take some book on algorithms and to solve couple of problems from it. Just to keep
brain if not sharp, but at least not rusty. Also diving in some problem of that kind
is the nice way to resurrect old math skills I was taught in the university.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Logging with log4net in Azure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Though you can configure basic logging for Azure using built in
&lt;a href=&#34;http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics/&#34;&gt;diagnostic tools&lt;/a&gt;
sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to have more control on logging. So it might be a good idea
to use log4net on top of the azure diagnostics and configure it to fit all your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m exploring and trying to learn Haskell, or at least get better understanding of
functional programming. So I thought it would be interesting to tease the brain
and reimplement some of Haskell parts in my &amp;ldquo;mother tongue&amp;rdquo; C#.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASCII Art With Python</title>
      <link>https://raol.io/post/ascii-art-with-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was always curious about creating cool ASCII &amp;ldquo;pictures&amp;rdquo; from actual images and finally decided to figure out how to do it.
It&amp;rsquo;s fairly simple. What we need to do is to resize image to fit in ASCII console (120 columns) keeping it&amp;rsquo;s original ratio.
Then convert it to greyscale and map grey level to ASCII symbol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
