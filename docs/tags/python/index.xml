      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since the last post was written. So it&amp;rsquo;s time to create new one. I know, I promised to explain
how to choose $ \alpha $ parameter and why it matters, but not this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Machine learning with python. Linear regression. Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the first article on linear regression I promised to show how to do it better, 
so this post will be about truly scientific approach to the problem. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you 
don&amp;rsquo;t get it off hand. Honestly speaking it took some time for me to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s going on
and even now from time to time I take some paper and draw matrices/vectors to be sure I&amp;rsquo;m doing 
everything right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m taking cool &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/ml&#34;&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; class at Coursera, so to get better understanding of the material,
decided to write a series of blog posts about it. As it clear from the post title, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain what linear regression is and how it works.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like to read long-long posts because somewhere in the middle I can&amp;rsquo;t get rid of feeling that the beginning of the post became vague and most of 
facts were forgotten. So it&amp;rsquo;s going to be short and painless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ASCII Art With Python</title>
      <link>https://raol.io/post/ascii-art-with-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was always curious about creating cool ASCII &amp;ldquo;pictures&amp;rdquo; from actual images and finally decided to figure out how to do it.
It&amp;rsquo;s fairly simple. What we need to do is to resize image to fit in ASCII console (120 columns) keeping it&amp;rsquo;s original ratio.
Then convert it to greyscale and map grey level to ASCII symbol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
